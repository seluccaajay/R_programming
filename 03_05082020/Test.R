# To find the solutions to an equation of the format  ax2+bx+c , use the quadratic equation:  x=???b±b2???4ac???2a .
# 
# What are the two solutions to  2x2???x???4=0  ? Use the quadratic equation.
# Report the positive solution first, using 3 significant digits for both solutions (both will be numbers).
